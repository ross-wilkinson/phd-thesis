    \caption[Rider CoM displacement occurred predominantly in the vertical direction during non-seated cycling.]{\textbf{Rider CoM displacement occurred predominantly in the vertical direction during non-seated cycling.} Data in the cubes show the group mean CoM trajectory (green) projected onto  three planes (black) during non-seated cycling under different power outputs (10$\%$, 30$\%$, and 50$\%$ P$_{max.i}$) at 70 rpm (left) and 120 rpm (right). The X, Y, and Z axes relate to CoM movement in the anterior-posterior, medio-lateral and vertical directions, respectively. Cartesian plots show the group mean CoM vertical displacement, velocity and acceleration with respect to crank angle (0\textdegree; top dead centre) under the same conditions. Note that displacement is the result of work done on, or by, the CoM. Velocity is the result of power generated on, or by, the CoM. Acceleration is the result of vertical interaction force between the bicycle and the rider.}
